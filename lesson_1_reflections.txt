It was more easier as in case of diff I only look at the changes
rather than looking at all the contents of the file.
This is particularly useful i n case of dense files.

It makes bug tracking easier as we can constantly check when which
changes were made.

some times we need to have multiple files saved parallely.

I can track down and control changes

For all my project work :D
